Alice has $$$n$$$ cards, the $$$i$$$-th of them has the integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it. Bob has $$$m$$$ cards, the $$$j$$$-th of them has the integer $$$b_j$$$ written on it.</p><p>On the first turn of the game, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the first player</span> chooses one of his/her cards and puts it on the table (plays it). On the second turn, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the second player</span> chooses one of his/her cards <span class="tex-font-style-bf">such that the integer on it is greater than the integer on the card played on the first turn</span>, and plays it. On the third turn, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the first player</span> chooses one of his/her cards <span class="tex-font-style-bf">such that the integer on it is greater than the integer on the card played on the second turn</span>, and plays it, and so on — the players take turns, and each player has to choose one of his/her cards with greater integer than the card played by the other player on the last turn.</p><p>If some player cannot make a turn, he/she loses.</p><p>For example, if Alice has $$$4$$$ cards with numbers $$$[10, 5, 3, 8]$$$, and Bob has $$$3$$$ cards with numbers $$$[6, 11, 6]$$$, the game may go as follows:</p><ul> <li> Alice can choose any of her cards. She chooses the card with integer $$$5$$$ and plays it. </li><li> Bob can choose any of his cards with number greater than $$$5$$$. He chooses a card with integer $$$6$$$ and plays it. </li><li> Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than $$$6$$$. She chooses the card with integer $$$10$$$ and plays it. </li><li> Bob can choose any of his cards with number greater than $$$10$$$. He chooses a card with integer $$$11$$$ and plays it. </li><li> Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than $$$11$$$, but she has no such cards, so she loses. </li></ul><p>Both Alice and Bob play <span class="tex-font-style-bf">optimally (if a player is able to win the game no matter how the other player plays, the former player will definitely win the game)</span>.</p><p>You have to answer two questions:</p><ul> <li> who wins if Alice is the first player? </li><li> who wins if Bob is the first player? </li></ul></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.
