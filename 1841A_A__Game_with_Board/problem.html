We can show that Bob can always win as follows: there are two possible first moves for Alice.</p><ul> <li> if Alice chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\{1, 2\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins; </li><li> if Alice chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\{3\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins. </li></ul><p>In the second test case, $$$n = 6$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\}$$$. Alice can win by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wiping them and writing $$$2$$$ on the first turn. Then the board becomes $$$\{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\}$$$, and there are three possible responses for Bob:</p><ul> <li> if Bob chooses four integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$4$$$, the board becomes $$$\{2,4\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins; </li><li> if Bob chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\{1,2,3\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins; </li><li> if Bob chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\{1, 1, 2, 2\}$$$. Alice can continue by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wiping them and writing $$$4$$$. Then the board becomes $$$\{1,1,4\}$$$. The only possible response for Bob is to choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$ and write $$$2$$$ instead of them; then the board becomes $$$\{2,4\}$$$, Alice cannot make a move, so she wins. </li></ul></div></div>
